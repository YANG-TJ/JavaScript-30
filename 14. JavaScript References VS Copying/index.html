  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //integer, string, boolen都是 copy(By Value)
    let age=100
    let age2 =age
    console.log(age,age2);
    age=200
    console.log(age,age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    // array, object, function (By Reference)
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team=players
    console.log(players,team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]='Abbey'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2=players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3=[].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4=[...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5=Array.from(players) //可用在 array, string轉為陣列

    team2[0]='aaa'
    team3[0]='bbb'
    team4[0]='ccc'
    team5[0]='ddd'
    console.log(players,team2,team3,team4,team5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const obj1={
      name:'Wes',
      age:100,
      social:{
        twitter: '@wesbos'      }
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    let obj2=Object.assign({},obj1,{age:12})
    let obj3=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1))
    console.log('obj1',obj1);
    console.log('obj2',obj2);
    console.log('obj3',obj3);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    
    // obj2['social']={twitter: '@Change',} //不影響 original obj1
    obj2['social']['twitter']= '@Change2' //obj1 深層仍受影響
    console.log('obj1',obj1);
    console.log('obj2',obj2);
    console.log('obj3',obj3);
